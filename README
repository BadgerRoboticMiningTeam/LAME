To build:

You must have JoystickLibrary (https://github.com/WisconsinRobotics/JoystickLibrary) cloned in the top level, with the static C++ library copied into the top level.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 

If you're on linux: run make
             Windows: cmake --build .

To build the GUI:

You will need the C# version of JoystickLibrary, and copy the dll into the BaseStation folder. Then open the solution and build within Visual Studio.
